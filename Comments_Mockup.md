# mindweaver

Mockup site is based on web2py

https://mindweaver.pythonanywhere.com/mindweaver/default/index#

This version of the site seems too dense and I have to admit that it could get messy once the user has more than ten weaves in a rubric. Therefore it might be better to give each rubric (forme, fromme, forothers) a separate page. I made some drawings to illustrate that idea.
